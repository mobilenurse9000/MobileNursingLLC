            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm a nurse. Dealing drugs and wiping butts is what I do for a living.</p>
            <p>Sometimes in nursing we deal with <i>crap.</i> More <i>crap</i> piled on top of <i>even more crap.</i> Then we clean up. And then we do it all over again.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it is nihilistic to think we benefit from other peoples' suffering. Even so, we care for others.</p>
            <p>When the time comes, we might all just be automated away from bedside, but that is probably not within our generation.</p>
            <p>I am just one of the many strugglers trying to pave a way for myself in this cruel world with the power of compassion, empathy, and a whole lot of bull@$%#!</p>
            <p>Follow me on a journey of self discovery and running away from my problems.</p>
            <p>Together we can. The American Dream lives on. Grandma has always been a fighter and so are you.</p>
